= cvs_tools

== Description

This is a small collection of script I use to work with CVS.

== Tools

 * create_cvs_branch - Tag the cvs tree at a given time stamp and create a new
branch starting at that tag.
 * cvs_status - Filter the output from cvs status to only show files that are 
interesting (have local changes, and/or need to be updated)
 * get_branch_changes - Determine if any changes have been made to a given 
branch since the specified time.
